[Caution: do not modify anything except the values after the equal signs]

[Synaptic Weights Importation]
synaptic weights matrix filename    = insert_your_matrix_filename_here, e.g., DIV66_gji
matrix format (full/nonzero)#       = nonzero
matrix delimiter (tab/space/;/...)  = space
matrix multiplying factor [beta]    = 2

[Data Exportation]
export voltage  time series         = false
export recovery time series         = false
export current  time series         = false

[Numerical Settings]
simulation duration          [T]    = 10000
time step size              [dt]    = 0.05
white noise strength     [sigma]    = 3
seed to random number generation    = 0
constant driving current strength   = 0
spiking truncation time (ms)        : automatic

[Suppression of Synaptic Weights]
suppression level                   = 0
type of links (inh/exc)             = inh
neurons to be suppressed            =
(blank: suppress all neuron nodes)
(this option allows incoming links
 of individual neurons to be
 suppressed, index starts from 1)


#full:      the data file stores a full size NxN matrix
#nonzero:   the data file stores only the nonzero elements with format (j i gji)
