[Data Input]
file name of synaptic weight matrix = DIV66_gji
matrix format (full/nonzero)#       = nonzero
matrix size (for nonzero format)    = 4095
matrix delimiter (tab/space/;/...)	= space

[Numerical Settings]
time step size              [dt]	= 0.05
simulation duration          [T]	= 10000
white noise strength     [sigma]	= 3
matrix adoption parameter [beta]	= 2
seed to random number generation	= 0
spiking truncation time (ms)		= auto
(auto: calculate from parameters)

[Suppression of Synaptic Weights]
suppression level                   = 0
type of links (inh/exc)             = inh
neurons to be suppressed            =
(blank: suppress all neuron nodes)
(this option allows incoming links
 of individual neurons to be
 suppressed, index starts from 1)

[Parameters for Synapse Model]
threshold potential (inh) [V_I]		= -80
threshold potential (exc) [V_E]		= 0
decay time constant (inh) [tau]		= 6
decay time constant (exc) [tau] 	= 5

[Initial Values]
membrane potential (mV)         	= -65
recovery variable               	= 8

[Data Output]
export time series of variables		= false
(membrane potential)

#full:      the data file stores a full size NxN matrix
#nonzero:   the data file stores only the nonzero elements with format (j i gji)
